## About VNTurtle

Vietnam is a country with a high biodiversity of turtles, including 26 species of tortoises and freshwater turtles. All 26 species are currently on the brink of extinction and are strictly protected by Vietnamese law against captive breeding and trading without proper legal permits. However, in Vietnam, turtles are being illegally traded in markets, sidewalks, and on social media. Sometimes both sellers and buyers are unaware that they are violating the law.

VNTurtle was created as a technological solution to contribute to turtle conservation in Vietnam. Its mission is to protect and conserve tortoises and freshwater turtles in Vietnam through the power of technology and community action. The application utilizes Artificial Intelligence to identify the different species of turtles in Vietnam and provides conservation information about each species, helping users understand the conservation status and legal protection level of the turtles they encounter. From there, specific and practical actions can be taken to protect those turtle species.

VNTurtle is the undergraduate thesis of Mr. Le Hoang Phuc, a Computer Science student at Fulbright University Vietnam, class of 2018-2023.

VNTurtle collaborates with the Asian Turtle Program to use image data for training the Artificial Intelligence system and to consult on turtle conservation issues in Vietnam.
